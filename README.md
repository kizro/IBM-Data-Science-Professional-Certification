# IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certification

##Description 

Prepare for a career in the **high-growth field of data science**. In this program, you’ll develop the skills, tools, and portfolio to have a competitive edge in the job market as an entry-level data scientist. Data science involves gathering, cleaning, organizing, and analyzing data with the goal of extracting helpful insights and predicting expected outcomes. The demand for skilled data scientists who can use data to tell compelling stories to inform business decisions has never been greater. 

**You’ll learn in-demand skills** used by professional data scientists including databases, data visualization, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, machine learning algorithms, and data mining. You’ll also work with the latest languages, tools,and libraries including Python, SQL, Jupyter notebooks, Github, Rstudio, Pandas, Numpy, ScikitLearn, Matplotlib, and more.

This Professional Certificate has a strong emphasis on applied learning and includes a series of hands-on labs in the IBM Cloud that give you practical skills with applicability to real jobs.

**Tools**: Jupyter / JupyterLab, GitHub, R Studio, and Watson Studio

**Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, ipython-sql, Scikit-learn, ScipPy, etc.

**Projects**:

 - Extract and graph financial data with the Pandas Python library

 - Use SQL to query census, crime, and school demographic data sets

 - Wrangle data, graph plots, and create regression models to predict housing prices with data science Python libraries

 - Create a dynamic Python dashboard to monitor, report, and improve US domestic flight reliability

 - Apply and compare machine learning classification algorithms to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not

 - Train and compare machine learning models to predict if a space launch can reuse the first stage of a rocket
